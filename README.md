Student Directory
=================

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled on the course at Makers Academy! It accepts typed input, or can import a list of students from (and save to) a .csv file.

How to Use
----------

You'll need to have Ruby installed on your machine.

Clone this repository to your computer
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ruthearle/student-directory.git
```

. Then, at the command prompt, ```cd``` into the repository directory, and run:

```shell
$ ruby directory.rb
```

If you want to load up a CSV file containing student information, you can specify this as an argument when running the script:

```shell
$ ruby directory.rb <FILENAME>.csv
```

Your CSV file should be in the format *student name*, *student cohort month*, *student hobby*.
